My name is Petar Kujundžić. I'm a software developer.
 
I've been doing this for quite some time, and for the past 2 years me and my team are developing scalable micro-service platform written in Elixir, hosted on AWS, glued with Kafka. 

We are doing really interesting stuff, so I want to share some of my thoughts, frustrations and excitements..
